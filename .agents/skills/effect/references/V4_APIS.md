# Current v4 API Checkpoints

Reviewed against Effect 4.0.0 at upstream commit
[`6389d9ac6`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/6389d9ac64c0f62ccc8b575fb9afc65fc104e814).
Always inspect the consuming project's pinned version before applying these changes.

## Imports

Current v4 groups modules by domain without the prerelease `unstable` segment:

```ts
import { Config, Context, Effect, Layer, Schema } from "effect"
import { FetchHttpClient, HttpClient } from "effect/http"
import { HttpApi, HttpApiBuilder } from "effect/http-api"
import { SqlClient } from "effect/sql"
import { Rpc, RpcGroup } from "effect/rpc"
import { Atom } from "effect/reactivity"
import { TestClock } from "effect/testing"
```

Direct imports such as `effect/http/HttpClient` also work. Check `effect/package.json`
exports instead of mechanically moving every `@effect/*` package into `effect`:
platform adapters, framework integrations, SQL drivers, and `@effect/vitest` still
have separate packages. The root barrel does not re-export every domain module.

## Common Migration Traps

| Older API or assumption | Current v4 |
| --- | --- |
| `Config.string`, `boolean`, `redacted` | `Config.String`, `Boolean`, `Redacted` |
| `Config.mapOrFail` | `Config.mapEffect`; failure must be `Config.ConfigError` |
| `effect/unstable/http` | `effect/http` |
| Root `TestClock` import | `effect/testing` |
| `Context.Tag` / `Effect.Service` service definitions | `Context.Service` plus explicit `Layer` implementations |
| `Effect.catchAll` | `Effect.catch`; prefer `catchTag` for selected tagged errors |
| `Effect.fork` / `forkDaemon` | `Effect.forkChild` / `forkDetach`; prefer `forkScoped` for layer-owned work |
| `Either` | `Result`; inspect constructors and payload fields rather than just renaming the import |
| `Schema.makeEffect` failures are `SchemaError` | Instance `schema.makeEffect` fails with `SchemaIssue.Issue` |

## Validation Boundaries

```ts
const Port = Schema.Int.check(Schema.isBetween({ minimum: 1, maximum: 65535 }))

const config = Config.schema(Port, "PORT")
const constructed = Port.makeEffect(8080) // failure: SchemaIssue.Issue
const decoded = Schema.decodeUnknownEffect(Port)(8080) // failure: Schema.SchemaError
const wrapped = constructed.pipe(
  Effect.mapError((issue) => new Schema.SchemaError(issue)),
)
```

See `SCHEMA.md` for constructor defaults, wire decoding, and error handling;
`CONFIG.md` for provider-based configuration; and `TESTING.md` for virtual time.

skill. A name appearing in a source comment is not evidence that it is exported.
