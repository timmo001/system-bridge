# 4.x.x Migration

This project was originally python based backend with tauri a rust based desktop framework using react for the frontend.

The documentation for System Bridge is at @https://system-bridge.timmo.dev/

All code for System Bridge can be found on GitHub.

- The original tauri (rust) application is at @https://github.com/timmo001/system-bridge/tree/4.1.13/*
- The original models / schemas named `systembridgemodels` is at @https://github.com/timmo001/system-bridge-models/*
- The original backend named `systembridgebackend` is at @https://github.com/timmo001/system-bridge-backend/*
- The original CLI named `systembridgecli` is at @https://github.com/timmo001/system-bridge-cli/*
- The original frontend named `systembridgefrontend` is at @https://github.com/timmo001/system-bridge-frontend/*
- The original shared code named `systembridgeshared` is at @https://github.com/timmo001/system-bridge-shared/*
- The original windows sensors named `systembridgewindowssensors` is at @https://github.com/timmo001/system-bridge-windows-sensors/*
- The python connector named `systembridgeconnector` is at @https://github.com/timmo001/system-bridge-connector/*
  - This is used in the home assistant implementation

The Home Assistant implementation is found at @https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/system_bridge/*
This uses `systembridgeconnector` for its package. When I ask what the original implementation, use this as the source of truth. For example, if I ask what units did this originally use, find the units/unit system/measurement in the Home Assistant implemtation.
When setting up data modules in data/module/ use the units used by home assistant. We want to make sure 5.0.0 is a near replica of 4.x.x and that there are no changes required in the Home Assistant integration.

Make sure to verify the units in the new implementation match the Home Asssistant implementation/integration units of measurement. If they don't, convert them to match.
