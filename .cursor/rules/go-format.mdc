# Go formatting guidelines

- **Requirement**: After any edit to Go code, always run the formatter.
- **Command**: Prefer `go fmt ./...` from the repository root.
- **Alternative**: If needed, `gofmt -s -w .` from the repository root.

This keeps the codebase consistently formatted across all Go packages.
