# GitHub Workflows

## Local Testing

- Use `act` for testing GitHub workflows locally

## Usage

- Run all workflows: `act`
- Run specific workflow: `act -W .github/workflows/workflow-name.yml`
- Run specific job: `act -j job-name`
- List all workflows: `act -l`

Any commands which rely on docker should be ran with sudo.

## Environment

- Create `.env` file for secrets
- Use `-s GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token` for actions requiring GitHub token

## Best Practices

- Test workflows locally before pushing to remote
- Keep workflow files modular and focused
- Use reusable actions when possible
- Document required secrets and environment variables
- Test both success and failure scenarios
