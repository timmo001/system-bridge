# Project

- This project is called System Bridge.
- It supports Windows, Linux, and MacOS (darwin).
- This application is written in @Go
- The aim of this project is to provide a "bridge" to other applications, such as the home automation platform Home Assistant.
- All parts of the application which are exposed outside via the API (such as HTTP and Websockets) should be protected with a token, which is stored in a separate file and managed by utils/token.go.
- Settings are shared between packages and found in [settings.go](mdc:settings/settings.go). Token and port are handled separately - token is stored in a separate file (utils/token.go) and port is read from SYSTEM_BRIDGE_PORT environment variable (default 9170).
- The backend and packages it uses and it only are under backend/
- All data modules are under data/module/*
- All data handlers are under event/handler/*
  - Data handlers should contain one function to register and get data. Any functions should be placed in a seperate package at event/handler/<module>/*
- The websocket is at [websocket.go](mdc:backend/websocket/websocket.go). Messages are handled in [messages.go](mdc:backend/websocket/messages.go). Its handlers are found at [handlers.go](mdc:backend/websocket/handlers.go). Accessing the websocket internally can be done from using [instance.go](mdc:backend/websocket/instance.go).
- HTTP endpoints are found under backend/http/*
- All shared utility functions are under utils/*
