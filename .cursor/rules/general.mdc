# General

- Use the @Web for documentation
- Make sure all commands used are cross platform and work on all distributions (distros)
- Test any commands used in exec commands. For example, `hostname -f` should be ran first to check if it is installed.
- Any commands which are not typically installed on certain distributions, should be added to the documentation.
