description: Platform/OS, CPU, and dependency support policy for System Bridge
---

# Platform and Support Policy

- **Supported operating systems**:

  - **Linux**: Support most distributions; prioritize Arch Linux and Ubuntu/Debian for examples and CI targets.
  - **Windows**: Support the latest Microsoft-supported Windows. Prioritize commands for the latest Windows release using modern PowerShell/Windows Terminal.
  - **macOS (Darwin)**: Experimental support only, targeting the latest Apple-supported macOS.

- **CPU architectures**:

  - **Intel / AMD Ryzen / Apple Silicon** only.
  - **Modern systems only**: No legacy/32-bit targets.

- **Command conventions**:

  - **Windows**: Prefer modern PowerShell commands and current package managers (e.g., `winget`), targeting the latest Windows version.
  - **Linux**: Provide instructions primarily for Arch (`pacman`) and Debian/Ubuntu (`apt`). When relevant, note general commands applicable across distros.
  - **macOS**: Use Homebrew for examples where dependencies are required.

- **Documentation for dependencies**:

  - When introducing any external application, library, or system package requirement, add clear install and setup instructions to the dependencies section of [README.md](mdc:README.md).
  - Include per-OS guidance where applicable:
    - Arch Linux: `yay` (AUR) or `pacman` (official) commands
    - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt` commands
    - Windows: `winget` (prefer) or `choco` if needed
    - macOS: `brew`
  - Keep steps minimal, modern, and specific to supported platforms only.

- **Testing expectations**:

  - Ensure changes build and run on **Linux** and **Windows**. macOS is non-blocking but should not be broken.
  - Avoid platform-specific behavior that regresses other supported platforms.

- **Scope and exclusions**:

  - Do not add code or instructions for unsupported/legacy operating systems or architectures.
  - Avoid legacy or deprecated command syntaxes; use the most current, widely available equivalents for each platform.
