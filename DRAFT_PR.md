# Draft Pull Request: Add Command Execution Feature with Allow-List Security

## Description

This PR implements arbitrary command execution functionality for System Bridge with a security-focused allow-list approach, addressing [Issue #3452](https://github.com/timmo001/system-bridge/issues/3452).

### üéØ **Problem Solved**
Users can now execute system commands through System Bridge (e.g., `kscreen-doctor --dpms off` to turn off monitors) with robust security controls. This enables powerful automation scenarios with Home Assistant and other platforms while maintaining system security.

### üîí **Security Features**
- **Allow-list only**: Commands must be pre-configured and explicitly enabled
- **No arbitrary execution**: Users cannot run commands not in their allow-list
- **Comprehensive validation**: Command validation with warnings for dangerous patterns
- **Enable/disable controls**: Individual command management
- **Full audit logging**: All execution attempts are logged

### üåê **Cross-Platform Support**
- **Windows**: Support for .exe, .com, .bat, .cmd with automatic extension resolution
- **Linux**: Native shell command execution (perfect for kscreen-doctor, systemctl, etc.)
- **macOS**: Full Unix-like command support

### üì° **Dual API Interface**
- **WebSocket API**: Real-time execution with structured responses
- **HTTP REST API**: Standard endpoints for external automation platforms

## Changes Made

### Backend Implementation

#### Core Components
- **`settings/settings.go`**: Added `SettingsCommand` and `SettingsCommands` structures
- **`utils/handlers/command/command.go`**: Cross-platform command execution utility
- **`event/handler/run-command.go`**: WebSocket handler for command execution
- **`backend/http/commands.go`**: HTTP REST API endpoints
- **`event/event_types.go`** & **`event/response_types.go`**: Event system integration

#### New Event Types
- `RUN_COMMAND` - Execute a named command
- `COMMAND_EXECUTED` - Command execution successful
- Error subtypes: `COMMAND_NOT_FOUND`, `COMMAND_NOT_ALLOWED`, `MISSING_COMMAND`

#### HTTP Endpoints
- `POST /api/commands` - Execute a command by name
- `GET /api/commands` - List all enabled commands

### Frontend Implementation

#### UI Components
- **`command-settings.tsx`**: Comprehensive command configuration interface
  - Add/edit/delete commands with inline editing
  - Dynamic argument management
  - Enable/disable toggles
- **`command-executor.tsx`**: Command execution interface
  - Grid layout of executable commands
  - Real-time execution status and results
  - stdout/stderr/exit code display
- **`card.tsx`**: Reusable card components for consistent UI

#### Integration
- Updated settings page to include command configuration
- Added dedicated commands page for execution
- TypeScript types for all command-related structures

## Usage Examples

### Configuration
```json
{
  "commands": {
    "commands": [
      {
        "name": "turn-off-monitors",
        "description": "Turn off all monitors using kscreen-doctor",
        "command": "kscreen-doctor",
        "args": ["--dpms", "off"],
        "enabled": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### HTTP API
```bash
# Execute command
curl -X POST http://localhost:9170/api/commands \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
  -d '{"name": "turn-off-monitors"}'

# List commands
curl -X GET http://localhost:9170/api/commands \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token"
```

### WebSocket API
```javascript
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "event": "RUN_COMMAND",
  "data": { "name": "turn-off-monitors" },
  "token": "your-token"
}
```

### Home Assistant Integration
```yaml
rest_command:
  system_bridge_run_command:
    url: "http://your-host:9170/api/commands"
    method: POST
    headers:
      Content-Type: application/json
      Authorization: "Bearer {{ states('input_text.system_bridge_token') }}"
    payload: '{"name": "{{ command_name }}"}'

automation:
  - alias: "Turn off monitors when away"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.presence_sensor
        to: 'off'
        for: '00:05:00'
    action:
      - service: rest_command.system_bridge_run_command
        data:
          command_name: "turn-off-monitors"
```

## Testing Instructions

### Backend Testing
1. **Build and run System Bridge**
   ```bash
   go build && ./system-bridge
   ```

2. **Test HTTP API**
   ```bash
   # List commands (should return empty array initially)
   curl -X GET http://localhost:9170/api/commands \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   
   # Configure a test command via settings
   # Then execute it
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9170/api/commands \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"name": "test-command"}'
   ```

3. **Test WebSocket API**
   - Connect to `ws://localhost:9170/api/websocket`
   - Send RUN_COMMAND event
   - Verify COMMAND_EXECUTED response

### Frontend Testing
1. **Navigate to Settings**
   - Verify command configuration UI appears
   - Test adding/editing/deleting commands
   - Test enable/disable toggles

2. **Navigate to Commands Page**
   - Verify enabled commands appear
   - Test command execution
   - Verify result display (stdout/stderr/exit codes)

### Cross-Platform Testing
- **Linux**: Test with `echo "hello"`, `ls -la`, `kscreen-doctor --dpms off`
- **Windows**: Test with `dir`, `echo hello`, batch files
- **macOS**: Test with `echo "hello"`, `ls -la`, system utilities

## Known Issues / Considerations

### TypeScript Configuration
The frontend implementation has some TypeScript configuration issues:
- Missing React type declarations
- JSX configuration issues
- These are likely project-specific and need resolution in:
  - `tsconfig.json`
  - `package.json` (ensure `@types/react` is installed)
  - `next.config.js`

### Security Considerations
- Commands are validated but not sandboxed
- Users should be cautious about enabled commands
- Consider adding command timeout settings in future iterations
- Consider adding working directory configuration

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Command timeout configuration
- [ ] Working directory specification
- [ ] Environment variable support
- [ ] Command scheduling/cron-like functionality
- [ ] Command output streaming for long-running commands

## Breaking Changes
**None** - This is a purely additive feature that doesn't modify existing functionality.

## Backward Compatibility
- Existing settings files will automatically get `commands.commands: []` default
- All existing APIs remain unchanged
- No migration required

**Note**: This PR is marked as draft due to TypeScript configuration issues in the frontend. The core functionality is complete and working, but frontend compilation needs TypeScript setup fixes specific to the project configuration.
