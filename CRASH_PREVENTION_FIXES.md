# System Bridge - Crash Prevention Fixes

This document outlines all the crash prevention measures implemented to make the System Bridge application more resilient and prevent unrecoverable crashes.

## Overview

The System Bridge application has been enhanced with comprehensive error handling, panic recovery, and defensive programming practices to ensure it can continue running even when encountering unexpected errors or edge cases.

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Replaced Fatal Exits with Error Handling

**Problem**: `log.Fatal` and `log.Fatalf` calls cause immediate application termination.

**Files Fixed**:
- `main.go`: Lines 72, 79, 87, 151, 158
- `backend/backend.go`: Lines 37, 65
- `data/update.go`: Line 33

**Solution**: Replaced with proper error handling that returns errors instead of terminating the application.

### 2. Global Panic Recovery

**Problem**: Unhandled panics in goroutines could crash the entire application.

**Implementation**:
- Added global panic recovery in `main.go`
- Added panic recovery to all goroutines in:
  - Signal handlers
  - Systray handlers
  - WebSocket message handlers
  - HTTP request handlers
  - Event bus handlers
  - Data update processors

### 3. Index Out of Bounds Protection

**Problem**: Array/slice access without bounds checking could cause panics.

**Files Fixed**:
- `data/module/battery.go`: Added bounds checking for battery array access
- `data/module/processes.go`: Added bounds checking for status slice access
- `data/module/displays/displays_linux.go`: Added bounds checking for display modes array

**Solution**: Added explicit length checks before array access.

### 4. Unsafe Type Assertion Fixes

**Problem**: Type assertions without checking could panic if types don't match.

**Files Fixed**:
- `event/handler/update-settings.go`: Line 43

**Solution**: Replaced unsafe type assertion with safe type assertion using the comma ok idiom.

### 5. Nil Pointer Dereference Protection

**Problem**: Accessing methods or fields on nil pointers causes panics.

**Implementation**:
- Added nil checks throughout the codebase for:
  - WebSocket server instances
  - Connection objects
  - Data store instances
  - Event router instances
  - Module updaters

### 6. WebSocket Connection Safety

**Problem**: WebSocket connections could cause crashes due to concurrent access or connection failures.

**Fixes**:
- Added panic recovery to all WebSocket handlers
- Improved connection cleanup with proper nil checks
- Added mutex protection for concurrent access
- Enhanced error handling for connection failures

### 7. Event Bus Resilience

**Problem**: Event handlers panicking could crash the event system.

**Fixes**:
- Added panic recovery to all event handlers
- Added nil checks for handlers and event bus instances
- Protected against nil handler registration

### 8. Data Store Thread Safety

**Problem**: Concurrent access to data store could cause race conditions or panics.

**Fixes**:
- Added proper read/write mutex usage
- Added nil checks for data store operations
- Added panic recovery for data loading/saving operations

### 9. Graceful Shutdown

**Problem**: Immediate `os.Exit(0)` calls don't allow for proper cleanup.

**Fixes**:
- Modified exit application handler to perform graceful shutdown
- Added timeout-based cleanup process
- Scheduled shutdown in separate goroutine to allow response sending

### 10. Resource Leak Prevention

**Problem**: Failed connections and resources not being properly cleaned up.

**Fixes**:
- Added proper connection cleanup in defer statements
- Enhanced error handling for resource allocation failures
- Added context-based timeouts for operations

## Error Handling Patterns

### 1. Panic Recovery Pattern
```go
defer func() {
    if r := recover(); r != nil {
        log.Errorf("Operation panic recovered: %v", r)
        log.Errorf("Stack trace: %s", debug.Stack())
        // Continue execution or return error
    }
}()
```

### 2. Nil Check Pattern
```go
if obj == nil {
    log.Error("Object is nil")
    return // or return error
}
```

### 3. Bounds Check Pattern
```go
if len(slice) == 0 {
    log.Debug("Slice is empty")
    return emptyResult, nil
}
// Safe to access slice[0]
```

### 4. Safe Type Assertion Pattern
```go
str, ok := data.(string)
if !ok {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("expected string but got %T", data)
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Application Resilience**: The application can now recover from most error conditions and continue running
2. **Better Error Visibility**: All errors are logged with stack traces for debugging
3. **Graceful Degradation**: When components fail, the application continues with reduced functionality
4. **Resource Safety**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks and resource exhaustion
5. **Thread Safety**: Concurrent operations are now protected against race conditions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Stress Testing**: Test with high concurrent load to verify thread safety
2. **Error Injection**: Deliberately cause errors to test recovery mechanisms
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Test behavior under low memory/disk space conditions
4. **Network Failures**: Test WebSocket and HTTP handling with network interruptions
5. **Invalid Input**: Test with malformed JSON and invalid data types

## Monitoring

The application now logs all recovered panics and errors, making it easier to:
- Identify recurring issues
- Monitor application health
- Debug problems in production
- Track error patterns

## Future Improvements

1. Add health check endpoints
2. Implement circuit breaker patterns for external dependencies
3. Add metrics collection for error rates
4. Implement automatic restart mechanisms for critical components
5. Add configuration validation at startup

## Conclusion

These fixes transform System Bridge from a crash-prone application to a resilient system that can handle errors gracefully and continue operating. The comprehensive error handling ensures that temporary failures don't result in complete application shutdown, significantly improving the user experience and system reliability.
